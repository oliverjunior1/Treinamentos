'''Create a variable i with the value 0
Write a while loop that runs as long as i is less than 6
Inside the loop: increment i by 1
If i equals 3, use continue to skip that iteration
Print i'''

# Create the i variable
i = 0
# While loop: print 1-5, skip 3 with continue
while i <6:
    i += 1
    if i==3:
        continue
    print(i)
